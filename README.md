# 🌼 flower_love 🌿

Welcome to **flower_love** – the digital greenhouse where green thumbs meet good vibes! 🌻🧤 Whether you're a plant whisperer, a dirt lover, or just someone who can *almost* keep a succulent alive – this is your space. 🪴💬

## 💡 What is flower_love?

**flower_love** is a plant-lovers paradise built with:

- ⚛️ React  
- 🧠 TypeScript (because bugs don’t grow well in strongly-typed soil)  
- 💨 Tailwind CSS (for styling smoother than a leaf in spring breeze)

This app lets you:

- 🌿 **Buy, sell, or trade** your precious leafy babies  
- 🌱 **Connect with other gardeners** who actually know the difference between soil and dirt  
- 🧵 **Share plant tips, photos**, and maybe even brag about that one fiddle leaf fig that’s *still* alive

## 🚀 How to Run It

1. Clone the garden... I mean repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YNhuLe/Flower_Love.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash 
   cd Flower_Love
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install 
   ```
4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```  
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see the magic happen! ✨
